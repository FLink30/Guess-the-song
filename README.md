# Guess-the-song
A music-game-app for children and teenagers. 

During the winter semester 2022/23 we designed a music-app prototype from scratch. The app should include one special feature, so i decided to develop a music game, where the users can play against their friends and have to gues the song. While playing the game they can like the song and the app automatically generates a playlist, which is available for both players. 

## Features:
- the user can create their own playlists etc.
- search for songs
- start a new game and choose a random player or a friend
- like the songs during the game and generate a playlist for them

## Goals:
- mood board
- persona
- suitable scenario of use
- content strategy
- information architecture
  - content of the app + use of content
  - nouns and verbs,  
  - site map
  - user flow  
- navigation design pattern
- paper based prototype
- wireframe prototype
- visual design
- high fidelity prototype
- iterative design process 'with a little help from my friends' (in form of feedback)
- use the Material design guidelines
- SmartWatch Prototype
- Design refelction
